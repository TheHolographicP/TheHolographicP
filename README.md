### Hi! I'm TheHolographicP.

✏️ I'm a Mechanical Engineer-In-Training working on enterprise IT infrastructure and applicaton integrations.  
📝 I help a technical team with no development experience leverage low-code toolsets like Microsoft Power Platform, XMPro, and Aveva Pi Vision to achieve buisness goals without needing to make every engineer a developer.  
🎓 I'm currently upskilling with a full-stack web development diploma from the University of Alberta.  
🚴 When not in front of a screen find me out on a bike or a pair of skiis.
